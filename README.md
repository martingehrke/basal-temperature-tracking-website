# basal-temperature-tracking-website
A site I put together a long time ago to track basal temperatures

## As Is
There is a lot here that could use clean up and fixing, but it basically works.

I removed the dbs/users.db which should be an sqlite db, you might need to create it by hand to begin. I will try to put the schema somewhere

## You should get charts
